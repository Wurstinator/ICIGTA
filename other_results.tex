\section{Infinite Words}

\begin{theorem}
	Every non-empty $\omega$-regular language contains an ultimately periodic word.
\end{theorem}
%TODO F4


\begin{theorem}
	For a Kripke structure $\mathcal{K}$ with initial state $s$ and $\varphi \in \text{LTL}$, the model checking problem $L(\mathcal{K}, s) \subseteq L(\varphi)?$ is PSPACE-complete.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
	\textbf{PSPACE} Compute the intersection automaton for $L(\mathcal{K}, s) \cap L(\neg \varphi)$ and test it for emptiness.
	
	\textbf{PSPACE-hard} Encode a poly.-length Turing tape as a Kripke structure and its correct behavior in LTL.
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}[Büchi]
	The MSO theory of $(\mathbb{N}, +1, <, 0)$ is decidable.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
	Corresponds to S1S formula. Can be checked with NBA emptiness test.
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}
	The FO theory of $(\mathbb{R}, +, <, 0)$ is decidable.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
	Encode real numbers $x$ by triples of sets $(X_s, X_i, X_f)$ with the number's sign ($X_s = \emptyset$ or $\{0\}$), the positive decimal digits in binary encoding, and the positive fractional digits in binary encoding. Then an FO sentence can be transformed to an equi-satisfiable MSO sentence over $(\mathbb{N}, +1, <, 0)$.
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}
	Subset-construction does not suffice to determinize NBAs.
\end{theorem}
%TODO F12

\begin{theorem}
	For every $n$, there is $L_n \subseteq \Sigma^\omega$ s.t. there is an NBA that recognizes $L_n$ with $n+2$ states, but every det. Rabin automaton that recognizes $L_n$ has at least $n!$ states.
\end{theorem}
%TODO F14

\begin{theorem}
	There is a DBA-recog. language which does not have a unique minimal DBA. \\
	DBAs minimized with the DFA minimization algorithm can be arbitrarily bad compared to a minimal DBA.
\end{theorem}
%TODO F18

\begin{theorem}
	Weak DBAs can be minimized uniquely in polynomial time.
\end{theorem}
%TODO F19

\begin{theorem}
	Given an ABA $\mathcal{A}$, the dual $\tilde{\mathcal{A}}$ is an alternating co-Büchi automaton which accepts $\overline{L(\mathcal{A})}$, with $\tilde{F} = Q \setminus F$ and $\tilde{\delta}$ exchanging true/false and $\land$/$\lor$.
\end{theorem}
